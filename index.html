						<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0027572/bio" class="md" target="_blank"
							>Wesley Wales Anderson</a
						>
						was born in Houston, Texas. His mother, Texas Ann (Burroughs), is an archaeologist
						turned real estate agent, and his father, Melver Leonard Anderson, worked in advertising
						and PR. He has two brothers, Eric and Mel. Anderson's parents divorced when he was a
						young child, an event that he described as the most crucial event of his brothers and
						his growing up. During childhood, Anderson also began writing plays and making super-8
						movies. He was educated at Westchester High School and then St. John's, a private prep
						school in Houston, Texas, which was later to prove an inspiration for the film
						<a href="#rushmore" class="md">Rushmore (1996)</a>.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class="md">
						Anderson attended the University of Texas in Austin, where he majored in philosophy. It
						was there that he met
						<a
							href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005562/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0"
							class="md"
							target="_blank"
							>Owen Wilson</a
						>. They became friends and began making short films, some of which aired on a local
						cable-access station. One of their shorts was
						<a href="#bottle-rocket" class="md">Bottle Rocket (1996)</a>, which starred Owen and his
						brother
						<a
							href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005561/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0"
							class="md"
							target="_blank"
							>Luke Wilson</a
						>. The short was screened at the Sundance Film Festival, where it was successfully
						received, so much so that they received funding to make a feature-length version.
						<a href="#bottle-rocket" class="md">Bottle Rocket (1996)</a> was not a commercial hit,
						but it gained a cult audience and high-profile fans, which included Martin Scorsese.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class="md">
						Success followed with films such as <a href="#rushmore" class="md">Rushmore (1998)</a>,
						<a href="#life-aquatic" class="md">The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004)</a>,
						<a href="#royal-tenenbaums" class="md">The Royal Tenenbaums (2001)</a> and an animated
						feature, <a href="#mr-fox" class="md">Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)</a>. The latter two films
						earned Anderson Oscar nominations.

						<h3 class="lg">Bottle Rocket</h3>
						<p class="md">
							Wes Anderson first illustrated his lovingly detailed, slightly surreal cinematic vision
							(with cowriter Owen Wilson) in this visually witty and warm portrait of three young
							misfits. Best friends Anthony (Luke Wilson), Dignan (Owen Wilson), and Bob (Robert
							Musgrave) stage a wildly complex, mildly successful robbery of a small bookstore, then
							go “on the lam.” During their adventures, Anthony falls in love with a South American
							housekeeper, Inez (Lumi Cavazos), and they befriend local thief extraordinaire Mr. Henry
							(James Caan). Bottle Rocket is a charming, hilarious, affectionate look at the folly of
							dreamers, shot against radiant southwestern backdrops, and the film that put Anderson
							and the Wilson brothers on the map.

						<h3 class="lg">Rushmore</h3>
						<p class="md">
							The dazzling sophomore film from Wes Anderson is equal parts coming-of-age story, French
							New Wave homage, and screwball comedy. Tenth grader Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is
							Rushmore Academy’s most extracurricular student—and its least scholarly. He faces
							expulsion and enters into unlikely friendships with both a lovely first-grade teacher
							(Olivia Williams) and a melancholy self-made millionaire (Bill Murray, in an
							award-winning performance). Set to a soundtrack of classic British Invasion tunes,
							Rushmore defies categorization, capturing the pain and exuberance of adolescence with
							wit, emotional depth, and cinematic panache.

						<h3 class="lg">The Royal Tenenbaums</h2>
						<p class="md">
							Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) and his wife, Etheline (Anjelica Huston), had three
							children—Chas, Margot, and Richie—and then they separated. Chas (Ben Stiller) started
							buying real estate in his early teens and seemed to have an almost preternatural
							understanding of international finance. Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) was a playwright and
							received a Braverman Grant of $50,000 in the ninth grade. Richie (Luke Wilson) was a
							junior champion tennis player and won the U.S. Nationals three years in a row. Virtually
							all memory of the brilliance of the young Tenenbaums was subsequently erased by two
							decades of betrayal, failure, and disaster. The Royal Tenenbaums is a hilarious,
							touching, and brilliantly stylized study of melancholy and redemption from Wes Anderson.

							their latest adventure. They are joined on their voyage by a young airline copilot (Owen
							Wilson), a pregnant journalist (Cate Blanchett), and Zissou’s estranged wife (Anjelica
							Huston). Wes Anderson has assembled an all-star cast that also includes Willem Dafoe,
							Jeff Goldblum, Michael Gambon, Noah Taylor, Seu Jorge, and Bud Cort for this wildly

							In director Wes Anderson's The Darjeeling Limited, three estranged American brothers

							three enormous poultry farms owned by three ferociously vicious farmers: Boggis, Bunce,
							and Bean. Mr. Fox simply cannot resist. Wes Anderson’s adaptation of Roald Dahl’s
